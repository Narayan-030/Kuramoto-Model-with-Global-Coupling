# Kuramoto-Model-with-Global-Coupling
The above code is the Kuramoto Model in a mean field case modelling the phenomenon of synchronization. There is a second order phase transition in the system from asynchronous to synchronous state. The code is not extremly optimized but does the job. I have used RK4 to numerically integrate.
